I'm convinced that a developer advocate _can_ be effective remotely. As a profession we've all spent two years figuring out how to do advocacy remotely. Some of it worked out great. Some of it, less so.

I link:/2022/04/01/hanging-up-my-boarding-passes-and-jetlagfor-now/[made the decision] during COVID to stop travelling as part of my role as a Developer Advocate. Here I talk about some of the things that I believe make important contributions as a Developer Advocate whilst staying at home. I'm deliberately avoiding the more general discussion of whether Developer Advocates *should* travel - I'm just talking about my personal experience of what *can* be done from home. 

== Virtual Conferences

bleugh. nah. nope. 

I've written before (link:/2020/12/03/life-as-a-developer-advocate-nine-months-into-a-pandemic/#_virtual_conferences_as_a_speaker[1] link:/2020/03/13/are-tech-conferences-dead/[2]) about virtual conferences so won't rehash it here. Short to say, as a speaker I've had my fill of talking to a faceless webcam, and I'm pretty sure as attendees most people are quite content to watch a video on YouTube at a later date than attending an online event that is almost, but not quite, entirely unlike an actual conference. 

A few managed to put on good virtual conferences. The folk over at Container Solutions put on link:/2020/03/13/are-tech-conferences-dead/#_software_circus[Software Circus] which was a good example of a virtual conference done well. But by-and-large, virtual conferences were and are a dispiriting affair for all involved. 

=== Video (YouTube)

_Just as the vacuum cleaner is known by most as a Hoover, the same for video platforms on which we dissemninate material for developers. It's YouTube and there's no point beating around that bush. TikTok et al are a different beast and I'm not considering those here._

Many Developer Advocates, http://youtube.com/rmoff[myself included], took to YouTube at the beginning of the pandemic. It was an obvious outlet - if we couldn't be on stage then damnit, we'd get ourselves in front of a camera. 

I recently wrote a Twitter thread with some stats from my YouTube

Just as some Developer Advocates will focus on conference speaking and have their keynotes down to a T, many nowadays will focus on video. As a result, it would not be unusual to expect a Developer Advocate to not only be comfortable on presenting on screen, but also producing and editing such a video.


=== Blogging

Blogging was always there for us when we were off the road, and now it's still here for us. Whilst some developers learn through watching, others through reading. A well-written blog can be the kind of material with a long, long tail. It can link:/2018/03/06/why-do-we-need-streaming-etl/[promote an idea], it can link:/2021/02/26/loading-delimited-data-into-kafka-quick-dirty-but-effective/[solve a specific problem], or link:/2019/12/18/detecting-and-analysing-ssh-attacks-with-ksqldb/[illustrate a fun idea]. 

=== Meeting developers where they are online

If you're not at conferences, or meetups, or customer site visits, how do you know what developers are doing? How can you advocate _for_ developers and not just _to_ them? The value of a Developer Advocate to an organisation is not just the outbound advocacy but the inbound. The bug reports, the "wouldn't it be neat if it did this", the "I was trying to build this thing with your product" stories. If you're face to face with developers you can't help but have these conversations. If you're not travelling, then you have to find that elsewhere. 

Thankfully in this day and age the internet is pretty much ubiquitous amongst developers. Getting answers from StackOverflow is second nature to many. Taking to twitter to chat and shitpost is standard. And amongst the shitposting and noise is golden nuggets of information. Conversations to spark up. Ideas to pursue. 

Some I've done whilst at Confluent is help launch a https://forum.confluent.io/[Discourse-based forum] to complement the existing Slack workspace that we have. With these two platforms I have tens of thousands of developers in my field of interest at my fingertips. 

As well as our own community platforms, I've had a lot of great interactions on StackOverflow, Twitter, and Reddit. Find out where your communities hang out, and go *to* them. A community platform that you curate and run is a nice space that's familar and important to have, but remember that developers may not take the time to look for *your* platform. General tech platforms like StackOverflow (and appropriate subreddits) are where devs also head, and if you don't participate in those then you're ignoring part of your audience. 

I see several concrete results from interacting with the online community: 

1. Enriching and strengthening the community by helping answer questions, model good behaviour, welcoming new users. 
2. Developing an online reputation as a person who is helpful and hopefully to be trusted, not just a shill who only talks _at_ developers. When my name is subsequently seen on a blog or video I'm _that guy_ who already helped them. 
3. Get ideas for blog posts and talks. Some of my most popular material started life as this. My favourite is an https://talks.rmoff.net/qrgjuz/all-at-sea-with-streams-using-kafka-to-detect-patterns-in-the-behaviour-of-ships[entire conference talk] sparked by interest in a single fascinating question that someone asked on our Slack group. 
4. Spot opportunity for product and documentation feedback. Sometimes this is just logging a ticket, oftentimes it's arranging an introduction between the community member and the relevant product manager or engineer related to the issue being discussed. 

=== Developer Experience 

The team of which I'm part of at work rolls up into a larger team called `DevX`, or Developer Experience. It broadly encompasses all the usual devrel areas you'd expect, but its name also suggests a crucial part of what a Developer Advocate can provide. Just as the interface on a web app will be designed and refined by the UX (User Experience) team, a developer's interactions with software, its APIs, and its documentation falls broadly under the "Developer Experience". 

Developer Advocates are well placed to be a key resource for improving developer experience, because they *are* developers, and part of their job is communicating. A good Developer Advocate should be able to not only identify a friction point but articulate how a developer would expect it to behave, and communicate clearly how to do this. That could be an API in the software, an error message, a tutorial, or anything else that developers interface with. 

=== Building stuff (the devex engineer role)

In recent times I've noticed an increase in the `Engineer` job title in the devrel space (`DevEx Engineer` for example), and it usefully captures a huge part of what some devrel folk do. Behind many brilliant talks lies some great code that enabled that demo. Supporting many a successful implementation of your product may be a library or set of hacks. Creating demos, writing the "sticky tape" scripts and examples - these are great examples of DevRel engineering. In many cases it will be the person doing the talk that wrote the demo, that spun out script from another talk into its own github repo. But there are plenty of cases where the engineer and advocate can work collaboratively for efficiency and scale. 

== So is travel redundant in developer advocacy? 

Don't be ridiculous :-P

Humans crave face-to-face interactions. Virtual conferences will _never_ come close to replicating that. The in-person conference will always be a thing, and Developer Advocates can play an important role in bringing new technologies and ideas to developers at these conferences.

My thesis is that you don't *have* to travel. It is not that you *shouldn't* travel.

This is also on a personal level. Can I, as a Developer Advocate, avoid travelling and still be effective? Yes, I think so. Can a company's entire DevRel efforts be done virtually as successfully as they might be with a proportion of travel involved? I would say not. 

== Footnote: Lockdown, no thanks

March 2020 (and several times thereafter) we in the UK were locked down. Nowhere was open (unless you needed to https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/dec/17/people-wont-forget-dominic-cummings-visit-barnard-castle-learns-to-live-with-notoriety[test your eyesight] or have a https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2021/dec/20/raab-says-pm-and-staffs-garden-gathering-was-within-lockdown-rules[work meeting]…), and people stayed at home. Now it's 2022 and we can thankfully go out again—and I've realised that even if I'm not travelling with work, I don't want to be at home 100% of the time. The same four walls, with interactions solely on Zoom or Slack, is not a great environment to be in without a break. I've taken to blocking out my calendar in the mornings on some days and just going to work in a coffee shop. I don't know what the logic of it is, because you'd think it would be more distracting than being at home, but something about it actually helps me focus. It was the same when I was travelling - a three hour train journey, or layover in an airport lounge somewhere, would sometimes be my most productive times.
