Building the program for any conference is not an easy task. There will always be a speaker disappointed that their talk didn't get inâ€”or perhaps an audience who are disappointed that a particular talk _did_ get in. As the chair of the https://www.confluent.io/en-gb/blog/introducing-current-2022-program-committee/[program committee] for https://2022.currentevent.io/[Current 22] one of the things that I've found really useful in building out the program this time round are the comments that the program committee left against submissions as they reviewed them. 

There were some common patterns I saw, and I thought it would be useful to share these here. Perhaps you're an aspiring conference speaker looking to understand what mistakes to avoid. Maybe you're an existing speaker whose abstracts don't get accepted as often as you'd like. Or perhaps you're just curious as to what goes on behind the curtains :)

Here are some of the headline mistakes that I've seen made, along with the quoted comments from the program committee when the reviewed the abstract in questionâ€¦

## Donâ€™t be too smart for your own good. Fancy titles alone donâ€™t suffice. 

> Unclear what it is about. Speakers got lost in the nice allegory, completely missing the actual core content.

> This talk could have been so amazing, but I have no idea what it's going to cover

> Knowing the speakers I'm sure they have some interesting tech to share, but from the abstract I just can't tell what

> Cute, but no detail as to why this talk would be interesting, what the basis for the talk is, technology involved, etc. 

> Fun theming but they've missed out the detail...

> best thing is the title. 

> want to like this, but we need more in the abstract; cannot pick a session by title alone

## The program committee are rooting for you to succeed - but a bad abstract is a bad abstract


> If you're going to copy & paste, at least remove the " In the webinar, " text first ðŸ¤¦

> Too sparse, also we don't do webinars. It's a pity though, the speaker writes cool blog posts usually.

> "Webinar"? Did you just copy & paste from another event my dude?

> The topic is great but the abstract is poor.

> this is not a webinar

> reads as if written within 1 or 2 minutes. and no, it's not a *webinar* you are submitting for :(

> not and abstract and looks to be a copy/paste of one at that.

> Not a webinar, no details.

> this abstract does not give me any confidence of quality content.

## Your clever title might actually not be so clever. Be conscious of its negative meanings and/or cultural resonances 


> controversial title. 

> I would not feel comfortable attending a talk with a suggestive title.

> Very unclear what the focus of the talk will be.

> the title creeps me out

> Is the titleâ€™s reference appropriate for a tech conference?

> Doesn't seem like a great speaker, and the title choice is really poor.

> title should get rephrased. "noob" is problematic

> agreed on great topic but needs a new title

> Would like to see a different title, but I like the concept.

> I don't think this title really works. 

> If accepted, I recommend we re-title the talk to avoid negative wording against people learning a technology for the first time.

> FTR not everyone loves being called a noob

## You might think you donâ€™t need to write much of an abstract, but the program committee will disagree


> I think it _would_ fit in general, but it's too thin.

> not enough information to accept

> unfortunately, abstract isn't enough.

> I've seen good talk from the submitter in the past. this abstract thought is rather condensed which is why I'm not convinced about this to be a breakout session.

> Abstract's quite thin. It's a shame because I know speaker has some strong opinions on this topic and I'm curious about what they are. :-(

> Will the talk be similarly thin on detail? 

> Too thin. A pity though, speaker is doing good stuff.

> Not enough detail in the abstract

> not enough in the abtract

> This abstract is short even for a lightning talk, let alone a breakout.

> extremely compact abstract for my taste. topic is very important though.

> Light abstract

> Abstract doesn't give any detail. 

> That's just not enough for an abstract. Which is sad, because I'm sure speaker has interesting things to tell. Really needs more detail to get me to bite.

> This speaker really needs to write longer abstracts. I have no idea what we are accepting.

> Vague

> Not clear what to expect from it.

> it's still unclear to me what the talk is about.

> Would love to see a mention of ANY technology here.

> details missing. either they didn't have them yet or they or disguising them - both not really good ways to convince reviewers :)

> Super vague. Vague, vague, vague.

> abstract doesn't really tell us anything other than finding insights with streams of events `Â¯\\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯`

> Topic sounds intriguing, but not enough information to rate it highly

> I am (potentially) interested, but I would need a more refined abstract to consider it.

## Help the program committee and they will help you. Hinder them, and they might not!


> Wall of text - struggling to understand what the attendee would get from the session

> huge text wall. hard to digest also the way it's written.

> This isn't very well written. Can we start with line breaks and then work out what each paragraph is trying to achieve?

> Very unclear abstract. Hard to read (use line breaks!). Next time start from the point of the audience - what will they gain from this talk? Why would it be interesting to them? 

## Make your abstract intelligible. Donâ€™t make people have to play detective and make assumptions about what youâ€™re talk is about


> I may not be the sharpest knife in the drawer, but I've read through this a few times and still can't quite make out what the talk is about.

> I sort of get the topic but I'm not sure how "real world" it is.  If this is just about potential solutions that haven't been validated in a real world context, it would have little value.

> This is really jumbled. I can just about figure out what the talk's going to be about, but an attendee shouldn't have to. 

> Really struggling to even get my head around the abstract. The usecase also doesn't seem too compelling based on what I've understood.

> I've read an abstract a few times. and I still don't understand what this talk is about

> Thin on details, still don't know what the talk is about.

> I'm really not sure what this talk is about.

## Sometimes you just canâ€™t winâ€¦ `:lolsob:`


> The scope feels too narrow[â€¦]

> this looks like a nicely focused topic [â€¦]

(these comments were left by two reviewers for the very same abstract)
