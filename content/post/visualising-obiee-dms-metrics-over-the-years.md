It struck me today when I was writing my most recent blog over at [Rittman Mead](http://ritt.md/obi-dms) that I've been playing with visualising OBIEE metrics for *years* now. 

* Back in 2009 I wrote about using something called JManage to pull metrics out of OBIEE 10g via JMX:

* Still with OBIEE 10g in 2011, I was using rrdtool and some [horrible-looking tcl hacking](/2010/12/06/collecting-obiee-systems-management-data-with-jmx/) to get the metrics out through jmx :

* 2014 brought with it DMS and my first forays with Graphite for storing & visualising data:

* My current weapon of choice is [OBIEE DMS metrics -> obi-metrics-agent -> InfluxDB -> Grafana](http://ritt.md/obi-dms)

Why's this interesting? I guess just that the numbers have always been there for the taking & use, but nowadays it is so easy to store them and interactively analyse them there is _no excuse_ not to be doing so!
