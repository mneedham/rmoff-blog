In link:/2022/09/14/stretching-my-legs-in-the-data-engineering-ecosystem-in-2022/[my quest] to bring myself up to date with where the data & analytics engineering world is at nowadays I'm going to build on my exploration of the link:/2022/09/14/data-engineering-in-2022-storage-and-access/[storage and access] technologies and look at how the tools we use for load and transforming this data.

The star of the show in 2022 seems to be very much dbt. Everywhere I look, it's dbt. People writing about data & analytics engineering are using dbt. Companies in the space with products to sell are cosying up to dbt and jumping on their bandwagon. 

It took me a while to grok where dbt comes in the stack but now that I (_think_) I have it, it makes a lot of sense. I can also see why, with my background, I had trouble doing so. Just as Apache Kafka isn't easily explained as simply another database, another message queue, etc, dbt isn't just another Informatica, another Oracle Data Integrator. It's not about ETL or ELT - it's about T alone. With that understood, things slot into place.
