_This is the software counterpart to link:/2020/12/02/my-workstation-2020/[my previous article] :)_

Some of these are unique or best-of-breed, others may have been https://www.economist.com/babbage/2012/07/13/youve-been-sherlocked[sherlocked] but I stick with them anyway :)

== https://www.alfredapp.com/[Alfred]

I've used https://www.alfredapp.com/[Alfred] for years, and it's one of the first apps I'll install on a fresh Mac. It's like the Cmd-Space search integration that MacOS has, but *so much more than that*. I started out with listing a few features here but it soon turned into a [love letter to Alfred] so head there for full details :)

After a while your menu bar starts to look like this:

Bartender is a nice little tool for rearranging the order of the icons, or even hiding them entirely! Particularly handy when you're presenting from your screen or recording a screencast. Plus you can customise its icon which is cool:

== Others

* https://bjango.com/mac/istatmenus/[iStatMenus] â€” CPU, memory, network, etc usage displayed on your menu bar, with hover-over drill-down visualisations. Neat!

* https://www.obdev.at/products/littlesnitch/index.html[Little Snitch] â€” very powerful way to monitor, and optionally block, specific network traffic for each process on your machine. 
* https://matthewpalmer.net/rocket/[Rocket] â€” emojis! ðŸ™Œ ðŸ™Œ

* SnagIt
* iTerm2
* Keynote! OMG Keynote! You can use the best slide creator now ðŸ˜„ Reason alone for getting the Mac!
* Screenflow
* Acorn
* Kap

* http://displaymenu.milchimgemuesefach.de/[Display Menu] â€” Great tool for quickly changing display resolution on different monitors - really handy when doing online talks etc and you want to make sure the screen resolution isn't too tiny for sharing

* https://manytricks.com/moom/[Moom] â€” Excellent utility for using the keyboard to move windows between desktops and resize to pre-configured places. I used to use https://www.irradiatedsoftware.com/sizeup/[SizeUp], this is like that on steroids :) It's worth the learning curve of training muscle memory for repositioning and resizing windows, especially if you have more than one monitor.
