This week I was scheduled in to a couple of meetups, in Vienna and Munich. Flying is an inevitable part of travel since I also happen to link:/2019/02/09/travelling-for-work-with-kids-at-home/[like being home seeing my family] and airplanes are usually the quickest way to make this happen. I don't particularly enjoy flying, and there's the environmental impact of it tooâ€”so when I realised that Vienna and Munich are _relatively_ close to each other I looked at getting the train. In the UK trains are generally a few hours, and certainly not overnight (bar a couple of exceptions), so the novelty of getting a sleeper train appealed. 

Would I do it again? Maybe. Here are my rough notes, to help others and to refresh my memory when I need it: 

* ðŸ”» Iâ€™d not factored in the fact that I would finish my meetup at ~21:00, and then have 2 hours with my backpack and case. I had never been to Vienna before so didnâ€™t know where to head. Bits of it were just shops and tourists, some bits felt a bit dodgy. Many restaurants were closing. Ended up at McDonalds in the station ðŸ˜•
* ðŸ”» Didnâ€™t realise that the train did not run straight through. It basically lays up in Salzburg for three hours. Didnâ€™t sleep for the stop/start confusion, as well as general unfamiliarity of the environment.
* ðŸ”» Iâ€™m now sat in Munich train station at 07:00, have been for 45 minutes already, and havenâ€™t showered and feel tired and yucky. I have a meetup tonight and hotel booked, but canâ€™t checkin until this afternoon. So Iâ€™m going to be coffee-shop surfing feeling rather grim and scruffy for a few hours.

* âœ” I got a â€˜private compartmentâ€™, which was totally worth it (200EUR, which was still cheaper than Vienna hotel plus VIE-MUC flight). Backpacking round Europe sharing a compartment with five strangers might be cost-effective, but no way I would be doing that now. Being able to open the blind when I wanted, leave my stuff out, etc etc made it all less stressful.

* âœ… OMG sunrise and watching the German countryside go by at 05:00â€¦quite possibly worth it all ðŸ˜€
