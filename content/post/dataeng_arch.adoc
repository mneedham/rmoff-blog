## Reference Architectures

Some things change…and some things stay the same. 9 years ago Oracle published their https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/database/bigdata-appliance/overview/bigdatarefarchitecture-2297765.pdf[reference archicture for Information Management and Big Data]. Whilst bits of it haven't aged so well, the core concept of how data is sourced, stored, and served seems to match up almost exactly with Databricks' https://www.databricks.com/glossary/medallion-architecture["Medallion Architecture"]. Which is a good thing - trends come and go but if as an industry we've settled on a common approach then it makes everyone's lives easier!

In February 2022 Oracle published https://docs.oracle.com/en/solutions/oci-curated-analysis/index.html[this reference architecture].

## Terminology

ELT / ETL / E(t)LT

Is it about where the work gets done and in what order, or does it suggest something about who and when the work get done by too?
