Recently added to the [oracledi project over at java.net](https://java.net/projects/oracledi/) is [an adaptor](https://java.net/projects/oracledi/) enabling Oracle GoldenGate (OGG) to send data to Elasticsearch. This adds a powerful alternative to [micro-]batch extract via JDBC from Oracle to Elasticsearch, which I wrote about recently [over at the Elastic blog](https://www.elastic.co/blog/visualising-oracle-performance-data-with-the-elastic-stack).

Elasticsearch is a 'document store' widely used for both search and analytics. It's something I've written a lot about ([here](/tag/elasticsearch/) and [here](http://www.rittmanmead.com/tag/elasticsearch) for archives), as well as [spoken about](https://speakerdeck.com/rmoff/data-discovery-and-systems-diagnostics-with-the-elk-stack) - preaching the good word, as it were, since the Elastic stack as a whole is very very good at what it does and a pleasure to work with. So, being able to combine that with my "day job" focus of Oracle is fun. Let's get started!

From the [adaptor page](https://java.net/projects/oracledi/downloads/directory/GoldenGate/Oracle%20GoldenGate%20Adapter%20for%20ElasticSearch), download the zip to your machine. I'm using Oracle's [BigDataLite VM](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/database/bigdata-appliance/oracle-bigdatalite-2104726.html) which already has GoldenGate installed and configured, and which I've also got Elasticsearch already on following on from [this earlier post](/2016/03/16/fun-and-games-with-oracle-goldengate-kafka-and-logstash-on-bigdatalite-4.4/). If you've not got Elasticsearch already, head over to [elastic.co](https://www.elastic.co/downloads/elasticsearch) to download it. I'm using version 2.3.1, installed in `/opt/elasticsearch-2.3.1`.

### Ready ... ##

Once you've got the OGG adaptor zip, you'll want to unzip it -- a word of advice here, specify the destination folder as there's no containing root within the archive so you'll end up with a mess of folder and files in amongst your download folder otherwise:

    unzip OGG_elasticsearch_v1.0.zip -d /u01/OGG_elasticsearch_v1.0

Copy the provided `.prm` and `.props` files to your OGG `dirprm` folder:

    cp /u01/OGG_elasticsearch_v1.0/dirprm/elasticsearch.props /u01/ogg-bd/dirprm/
    cp /u01/OGG_elasticsearch_v1.0/dirprm/res.prm /u01/ogg-bd/dirprm/

Edit the `elasticsearch.props` (e.g. `/u01/ogg/dirprm/elasticsearch.props`) file to set:

1. **gg.classpath**, to pick up both the Elasticsearch jars and the OGG adaptor jar. On my installation this is :

        gg.classpath=/opt/elasticsearch-2.3.1/lib/*:/u01/OGG_elasticsearch_v1.0/bin/ogg-elasticsearch-adapter-1.0.jar:

2. **gg.handler.elasticsearch.clusterName**, which is the name of your elasticsearch cluster - if you don't know it you can check with

        [oracle@bigdatalite ~]$ curl -s localhost:9200|grep cluster_name
        "cluster_name" : "elasticsearch",

    So mine is the default - **elasticsearch**:

        gg.handler.elasticsearch.clusterName=elasticsearch

3. For **gg.handler.elasticsearch.host** and **gg.handler.elasticsearch.port** I left the defaults (localhost / 9300) unchanged - update these for your Elasticsearch instance as required. Note that [Elasticsearch listens](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/guide/current/_talking_to_elasticsearch.html) on two ports, with 9200 by default for HTTP traffic, and 9300 for Java clients which is what we're using here.

### Steady ... ##

Run `ggsci` to add and start the replicat using the provided `res` configuration (**res** = **R**eplicat, **E**lastic**S**earch, I'm guessing) and sample trail file (i.e. we don't need a live extract running to try this thing out):

```bash
$ cd /u01/ogg-bd
$ rlwrap ./ggsci

GGSCI (bigdatalite.localdomain) 1> start mgr
Manager started.


GGSCI (bigdatalite.localdomain) 2> add replicat res, exttrail AdapterExamples/trail/tr
REPLICAT added.
```


### Go! ##

```bash
GGSCI (bigdatalite.localdomain) 3> start res

Sending START request to MANAGER ...
REPLICAT RES starting
```

Yay!

```bash
GGSCI (bigdatalite.localdomain) 5> info res

REPLICAT   RES       Initialized   2016-04-14 22:03   Status STOPPED
```

`STOPPED`? Oh ...

Time for debug. Open up `/u01/ogg-bd/ggserr.log`, and the error (_`Error loading shared library ggjava.dll_) is nice and clear to see:

	2016-04-14 22:04:25  INFO    OGG-00987  Oracle GoldenGate Command Interpreter:  GGSCI command (oracle): start res.
	2016-04-14 22:04:25  INFO    OGG-00963  Oracle GoldenGate Manager, mgr.prm:  Command received from GGSCI on host [127.0.0.1]:13379 (START REPLICAT RES ).

	2016-04-14 22:04:25  ERROR   OGG-01668  Oracle GoldenGate Delivery, res.prm:  PROCESS ABENDING.

But hang on ... **`ggjava.dll`** ? _**`dll`**_? This is Linux, not Windows.

So, a quick change to the `prm` is in order, switching `.dll` for `.so`:

	[oracle@bigdatalite ogg-bd]$ diff dirprm/res.prm dirprm/res.prm.bak
	5c5
	< TARGETDB LIBFILE libggjava.so SET property=dirprm/elasticsearch.props
	---
	> TARGETDB LIBFILE ggjava.dll SET property=dirprm/elasticsearch.props

### Second time lucky? ##

Redefine the replicat:

	GGSCI (bigdatalite.localdomain) 7> delete res
	Deleted REPLICAT RES.


	GGSCI (bigdatalite.localdomain) 8> add replicat res, exttrail AdapterExamples/trail/tr
	REPLICAT added.

And start it again:

	GGSCI (bigdatalite.localdomain) 9> start res

	Sending START request to MANAGER ...
	REPLICAT RES starting

Now it looks better:

	GGSCI (bigdatalite.localdomain) 14> info res

	REPLICAT   RES       Last Started 2016-04-14 22:10   Status RUNNING
	Checkpoint Lag       00:00:00 (updated 00:00:02 ago)
	Process ID           15101
	Log Read Checkpoint  File AdapterExamples/trail/tr000000000
						 2015-11-05 18:45:39.000000  RBA 5660

### Result! ##

Let's check out what's happened in Elasticsearch. The console log looks promising, showing that an index with two mappings has been created:

	[2016-04-14 22:10:08,709][INFO ][cluster.metadata         ] [Abner Jenkins] [qasource] creating index, cause [auto(bulk api)], templates [], shards [5]/[1], mappings [tcustmer, tcustord]
	[2016-04-14 22:10:09,458][INFO ][cluster.routing.allocation] [Abner Jenkins] Cluster health status changed from [RED] to [YELLOW] (reason: [shards started [[qasource][4]] ...]).
	[2016-04-14 22:10:09,488][INFO ][cluster.metadata         ] [Abner Jenkins] [qasource] update_mapping [tcustmer]
	[2016-04-14 22:10:09,658][INFO ][cluster.metadata         ] [Abner Jenkins] [qasource] update_mapping [tcustord]

We can confirm that with the Elasticsearch REST API:

	$ curl --silent -XGET http://localhost:9200/_cat/indices?pretty=true
	yellow open qasource 5 1 8 6 19.6kb 19.6kb

And see how many documents ("rows") have been loaded (8):

	$ curl -s -XGET 'http://localhost:9200/qasource/_search?search_type=count&pretty=true'
	{
	  "took" : 1,
	  "timed_out" : false,
	  "_shards" : {
		"total" : 5,
		"successful" : 5,
		"failed" : 0
	  },
	  "hits" : {
		"total" : 8,
		"max_score" : 0.0,
		"hits" : [ ]
	  }
	}

You can even see the mappings ("schema") defined within each index:

	$ curl -XGET 'http://localhost:9200/_mapping?pretty=true'
	{
	  ".kibana" : {
		"mappings" : {
		  "config" : {
			"properties" : {
			  "buildNum" : {
				"type" : "string",
				"index" : "not_analyzed"
			  }
			}
		  }
		}
	  },
	  "qasource" : {
		"mappings" : {
		  "tcustord" : {
			"properties" : {
			  "CUST_CODE" : {
				"type" : "string"
			  },
			  "ORDER_DATE" : {
				"type" : "string"
			  },
			  "ORDER_ID" : {
				"type" : "string"
	[...]

All this faffing about with `curl` is fine, but if you're doing proper poking with Elasticsearch you may well find [kopf](https://github.com/lmenezes/elasticsearch-kopf) handy:

![ogges01](/images/2016/04/ogges01.png)

It's easy to install:  (modify the path if your Elasticsearch binary is in a different location):

    /opt/elasticsearch-2.3.1/bin/plugin install lmenezes/elasticsearch-kopf

After installation, restart Elasticsearch and then go to http://localhost:9200/_plugin/kopf

If you're using Elasticsearch, you may well be doing so for the whole Elastic experience, using Kibana to view the data:

![ogges02](/images/2016/04/ogges02.png)

and even start doing quick profiling:

![ogges03](/images/2016/04/ogges03.png)

One issue with the data that's come through in this example is that it is _all_ string - even the dates and numerics (AMOUNT, PRICE), which makes instant-analysis in Kibana less possible.

# Streaming data from Oracle to Elasticsearch #

Now that we've tested and proven the replicat load into Elasticsearch, let's do the full end-to-end. I'm going to use the same Extract as the BigDataLite [Oracle by Example](http://www.oracle.com/webfolder/technetwork/tutorials/obe/fmw/odi/odi_12c/DI_BDL_Guide/BigDataIntegration_Demo.html?cid=10235&ssid=0) (you can see my notes on it [here](/2016/03/16/fun-and-games-with-oracle-goldengate-kafka-and-logstash-on-bigdatalite-4.4/) if you're interested).

Reset & recreate the Extract, in the first OGG instance (`/u01/ogg`)

	$ cd /u01/ogg/
	$ rlwrap ./ggsci

	GGSCI (bigdatalite.localdomain as system@cdb/CDB$ROOT) 1> obey dirprm/reset_bigdata.oby

	[...]

	GGSCI (bigdatalite.localdomain as system@cdb/CDB$ROOT) 2> info all

	Program     Status      Group       Lag at Chkpt  Time Since Chkpt

	MANAGER     RUNNING

	GGSCI (bigdatalite.localdomain) 3> obey dirprm/bigdata.oby

	[...]

	GGSCI (bigdatalite.localdomain as system@cdb/CDB$ROOT) 9> info all

	Program     Status      Group       Lag at Chkpt  Time Since Chkpt

	MANAGER     RUNNING
	EXTRACT     RUNNING     EMOV        00:00:03      00:00:00

Now define a new replicat parameter file, over in the second OGG instance (that we used above for the `res` test):

	cat > /u01/ogg-bd/dirprm/relastic.prm <<EOF

	REPLICAT relastic
	TARGETDB LIBFILE libggjava.so SET property=dirprm/elasticsearch.props
	REPORTCOUNT EVERY 1 MINUTES, RATE
	GROUPTRANSOPS 10000
	MAP orcl.moviedemo.movie TARGET orcl.moviedemo.movie;

	EOF

Remove the previous replicat (`res`) just to keep things clear:

	$ cd /u01/ogg-bd
	$ rlwrap ./ggsci

	GGSCI (bigdatalite.localdomain) 4> info all

	Program     Status      Group       Lag at Chkpt  Time Since Chkpt

	MANAGER     RUNNING

Add the new one (`relastic`):

	GGSCI (bigdatalite.localdomain) 1> add replicat relastic, exttrail /u01/ogg/dirdat/tm
	REPLICAT added.

And start it:

	GGSCI (bigdatalite.localdomain) 2> start relastic

	Sending START request to MANAGER ...
	REPLICAT RELASTIC starting

	GGSCI (bigdatalite.localdomain) 4> info relastic

	REPLICAT   RELASTIC  Last Started 2016-04-14 22:55   Status RUNNING

	Process ID           17564
	Log Read Checkpoint  File /u01/ogg/dirdat/tm000000000
						 First Record  RBA 1406

If we head over to the Elasticsearch, we'll see that ...

	$  curl --silent -XGET http://localhost:9200/_cat/indices?pretty=true
	yellow open qasource  5 1 8 6 19.6kb 19.6kb

... nothing's changed! Because, of course, nothing's changed on the source Oracle table that the Extract is set up against.

Let's rectify that:


	$ rlwrap sqlplus system/welcome1@orcl

	SQL*Plus: Release 12.1.0.2.0 Production on Thu Apr 14 23:01:57 2016

	SQL> INSERT INTO "MOVIEDEMO"."MOVIE" (MOVIE_ID, TITLE, YEAR, BUDGET, GROSS, PLOT_SUMMARY) VALUES ('42444', 'never gonna', '2014', '500000', '20000000', 'give you up');

	1 row created.

	SQL> COMMIT;

	Commit complete.

Check Elasticsearch again:

	$  curl --silent -XGET http://localhost:9200/_cat/indices?pretty=true
	yellow open qasource  5 1 8 6 19.6kb 19.6kb
	yellow open moviedemo 5 1 1 0  4.5kb  4.5kb

Much better - a new index! We've got a new index because the replicat is handling a different schema this time - moviedemo, not qasource.

We can look at the data in the index directly:

	$ curl -XGET 'http://localhost:9200/moviedemo/_search?q=*&pretty=true'
	{
	  "took" : 6,
	  "timed_out" : false,
	  "_shards" : {
		"total" : 5,
		"successful" : 5,
		"failed" : 0
	  },
	  "hits" : {
		"total" : 1,
		"max_score" : 1.0,
		"hits" : [ {
		  "_index" : "moviedemo",
		  "_type" : "movie",
		  "_id" : "42444",
		  "_score" : 1.0,
		  "_source" : {
			"PLOT_SUMMARY" : "give you up",
			"YEAR" : "2014",
			"MOVIE_ID" : "42444",
			"BUDGET" : "500000",
			"TITLE" : "never gonna",
			"GROSS" : "20000000"
		  }
		} ]
	  }
	}

You'll note that the primary key (`MOVIE_ID`) has been correctly identied as the unique document `_id` field. The `_id` is now where things begin to get interesting, because this field enables the new OGG-Elasticsearch adaptor to apparently perform "UPSERT" on documents that already exist.

To doublecheck this apparent method of handling of the data, I first wanted to validate what was coming through from OGG in terms of the data flowing through from the extract. To do this I hooked up a second replicat, to Kafka and on to Logstash into Elasticseach ([using this method](/2016/03/16/fun-and-games-with-oracle-goldengate-kafka-and-logstash-on-bigdatalite-4.4/)), and then compared the doc count in the two relevant indices (or strictly speaking, the mapping types, corresponding to each index).

To start with, I deleted all my Elasticsearch data, as this shows: 

	$ curl "localhost:9200/*/_search?search_type=count&pretty=true" -d '{
		"aggs": {
			"count_by_type": {
				"terms": {
					"field": "_type"
				}
			}
		}
	}'
	{
	  "took" : 2,
	  "timed_out" : false,
	  "_shards" : {
		"total" : 1,
		"successful" : 1,
		"failed" : 0
	  },
	  "hits" : {
		"total" : 0,
		"max_score" : 0.0,
		"hits" : [ ]
	  },
	  "aggregations" : {
		"count_by_type" : {
		  "doc_count_error_upper_bound" : 0,
		  "sum_other_doc_count" : 0,
		  "buckets" : [ ]
		}
	  }
	}

Then I insert a row on `"MOVIEDEMO"."MOVIE"` in Oracle (having previously truncated it):

	SQL> INSERT INTO "MOVIEDEMO"."MOVIE" (MOVIE_ID, TITLE, YEAR, BUDGET, GROSS, PLOT_SUMMARY) VALUES ('1', 'never gonna', '2014', '500000', '20000000', 'give you up');

	1 row created.

	SQL> commit;

	Commit complete.

and see it shows up in both Elasticsearch indices:

    $ curl "localhost:9200/*/_search?search_type=count&pretty=true" -d '{
		"aggs": {
			"count_by_type": {
				"terms": {
					"field": "_type"
				}
			}
		}
	}'
	[...]
      }, {
        "key" : "logs",
        "doc_count" : 1
      }, {
        "key" : "movie",
        "doc_count" : 1


* **`logs`** is the index mapping loaded through OGG --> Kafka --> Logstash --> Elasticsearch
* **`movie`** is the index mapping loaded through the new adaptor, OGG --> Elasticsearch

So far, so good. Now, let's add a second row in Oracle:

	SQL> INSERT INTO "MOVIEDEMO"."MOVIE" (MOVIE_ID, TITLE, YEAR, BUDGET, GROSS, PLOT_SUMMARY) VALUES ('2', 'foo', '2014', '500000', '20000000', 'bar');

	1 row created.

	SQL> commit;

	Commit complete.

Both indices match count:

     "buckets" : [ {
        "key" : "logs",
        "doc_count" : 2
      }, {
        "key" : "movie",
        "doc_count" : 2
      }, {

What about an update?

	SQL> UPDATE "MOVIEDEMO"."MOVIE" SET TITLE ='Foobar' where movie_id = 1;

	1 row updated.

	SQL> commit;

	Commit complete.

Hmmmm...

      "buckets" : [ {
        "key" : "logs",
        "doc_count" : 3
      }, {
        "key" : "movie",
        "doc_count" : 2
      }, {

The index loaded from the OGG-Elasticsearch Adaptor has only two documents still, whilst the other route has three. If we look at what's in the first of these (movie, loaded by OGG-Elasticsearch) for `movie_id=1`:

	[oracle@bigdatalite ogg-bd]$ curl -XGET 'http://localhost:9200/moviedemo/_search?q=_id=1&pretty=true'
	{
	  "took" : 2,
	  "timed_out" : false,
	  "_shards" : {
		"total" : 5,
		"successful" : 5,
		"failed" : 0
	  },
	  "hits" : {
		"total" : 1,
		"max_score" : 0.014065012,
		"hits" : [ {
		  "_index" : "moviedemo",
		  "_type" : "movie",
		  "_id" : "1",
		  "_score" : 0.014065012,
		  "_source" : {
			"PLOT_SUMMARY" : "give you up",
			"YEAR" : "2014",
			"MOVIE_ID" : "1",
			"BUDGET" : "500000",
			"TITLE" : "Foobar",
			"GROSS" : "20000000"
		  }
		} ]
	  }
	}

You can see it's the latest version of the row (`TITLE=Foobar`). In the second index, loaded from the change record sent to Kafka and then on through Logstash, there are *both* the before and after record for this key:

	}
	[oracle@bigdatalite ogg-bd]$ curl -XGET 'http://localhost:9200/logstash*/_search?q=*&pretty=true'
	[...]
		  "_source" : {
			"table" : "ORCL.MOVIEDEMO.MOVIE",
			"op_type" : "I",
			"op_ts" : "2016-04-14 22:34:43.000000",
			"current_ts" : "2016-04-14T23:34:45.131000",
			"pos" : "00000000000000003514",
			"primary_keys" : [ "MOVIE_ID" ],
			"tokens" : { },
			"before" : null,
			"after" : {
			  "MOVIE_ID" : "1",
			  "MOVIE_ID_isMissing" : false,
			  "TITLE" : "never gonna",
			  "TITLE_isMissing" : false,

	[...]

			"_source" : {
			"table" : "ORCL.MOVIEDEMO.MOVIE",
			"op_type" : "U",
			"op_ts" : "2016-04-14 22:39:37.000000",
			"current_ts" : "2016-04-14T23:39:39.583000",
			"pos" : "00000000000000004097",
			"primary_keys" : [ "MOVIE_ID" ],
			"tokens" : { },
			"before" : {
			  [...]
			  "TITLE" : "never gonna",
			  [...]
			},
			"after" : {
			  [...]
			  "TITLE" : "Foobar",
			  [...]

Finally, if I delete a record in Oracle:

	SQL> delete from "MOVIEDEMO"."MOVIE" where MOVIE_ID = 1;

	1 row deleted.

	SQL> commit;

	Commit complete.

My document counts reflect what I'd expect -- the OGG-Elasticsearch adaptor deleted the record from Elasticsearch, whilst the Kafka route just recorded another change record, of `op_type='D'` this time.

       "key" : "logs",
        "doc_count" : 4
      }, {
        "key" : "movie",

This adaptor is a pretty smart way of mirroring a table's contents from one of [the many RDBMS that GoldenGate supports](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/middleware/goldengate/certify-100402.html) as an extract source, into Elasticsearch.

If you want to retain history of changed records, then using [OGG->Kafka->Logstash->Elasticsearch](/2016/03/16/fun-and-games-with-oracle-goldengate-kafka-and-logstash-on-bigdatalite-4.4/) is an option.

And, if you don't have the spare cash for OGG, you can use [Logstash's JDBC input](https://www.elastic.co/blog/visualising-oracle-performance-data-with-the-elastic-stack) mechanism to pull data periodically from your RDBMS. This has the additional benefit of being able to specify custom SQL queries with joins etc - useful when pulling in denormalised datasets into Elasticsearch for analytics.
