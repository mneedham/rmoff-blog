There's an undocumented feature in AdminTool.exe that you can use the /command switch with a text file containing scripted commands to make changes to an RPD file (or create a new one).

It's undocumented and **UNSUPPORTED** so be careful using it.

Some good details in these blog posts, especially Erik's which has a good list of syntax.

I'm intrigued to know how the original posters figured out the commands available, if it's undocumented... :)

\[update\] Just discovered that CAF uses this functionality in order to Consistency Check the altered RPD that it can create: CAF uses commandline script: C:\\OracleBI\\server\\bin\\AdminTool /command C:\\CAF\_Training\\Target\\Consistency.config \[sourcecode language='bash'\] Open C:\\CAF\_Training\\Target\\paint.rpd Administrator Administrator Hide ConsistencyCheck C:\\CAF\_Training\\Target\\ConsistencyCheck.log Exit \[/sourcecode\] \[/update\]
