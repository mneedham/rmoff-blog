Quick post as the snow's coming down and I wanna go home ...

I've been working on building a VM based on OEL5.4 and OBIEE 10.1.3.4.1. After installing XE 10.2 I tried to fire my RPD up, but hit this:

> /usr/lib/oracle/xe/app/oracle/product/10.2.0/server/lib/libnnz10.so: cannot restore segment prot after reloc: Permission denied \[nQSError: 46029\] Failed to load the DLL /app/oracle/product/obiee/server/Bin/libnqsdbgatewayoci10g.so. Check if 'Oracle OCI 10G' database client is installed.

If you trace the 'stack' back you find that it parses down to this nub of an error:

> libnnz10.so: cannot restore segment prot after reloc: Permission denied

Google throws up a few hits, but not terribly detailed.

The error's to do with SELinux security. I'll hold my hand up now and say that I don't understand SELinux nor the implications of these commands except that it fixes my problem and I'm working in a sandbox environment. If you are working anywhere that this kind of thing matters then please consult with someone who knows what they're talking about first!

1. As root, generate a file of blocked activity (tail gets and follows the file, tee echoes it to stdout -the console- as well as writing it to the file oracle.log)
    
    tail -f /var/log/audit/audit.log | tee oracle.log
    
2. Do something in OBIEE to generate the error (run a report etc), you should see more output appear from the root session, like this:
    
    type=AVC msg=audit(1261159266.277:119): avc:  denied  { execmod } for  pid=9396 comm="nqsserver" path="/usr/lib/oracle/xe/app/oracle/product/10.2.0/server/lib/libnnz10.so" dev=dm-0 ino=3834074 scontext=user\_u:system\_r:unconfined\_t:s0 tcontext=system\_u:object\_r:lib\_t:s0 tclass=file
    type=SYSCALL msg=audit(1261159266.277:119): arch=40000003 syscall=125 success=no exit=-13 a0=3611000 a1=1dd000 a2=5 a3=b73313c0 items=0 ppid=1 pid=9396 auid=500 uid=500 gid=500 euid=500 suid=500 fsuid=500 egid=500 sgid=500 fsgid=500 tty=pts1 ses=1 comm="nqsserver" exe="/app/oracle/product/obiee/server/Bin/nqsserver" subj=user\_u:system\_r:unconfined\_t:s0 key=(null)
    
3. You can see snippets in there that are recognisable - the nqsserver program name and path. Press Ctrl-C to halt the tail command and return to the prompt.
4. Use the audit2allow program to add rules to permit the blocked behaviour:
    
    audit2allow -M nqsserver -i oracle.log
    
    Where -M defines a new module name (i've called it after nqsserver), and -i is the input file of blocked audit
5. You should be prompted to run semodule to activate the change:
    
    semodule -i nqsserver.pp
    
6. Now tail (no need to tee this time) the /var/log/audit/audit.log and repeat the activity you did before (run a report etc), and hopefully you won't get any entries this time. Doublecheck NQServer.log to make sure.
7. ? If a malicious program could do its blocked activity whilst you were 'recording' the audit file for blocked nqsserver might you end up allowing the malicious program inadvertently?
