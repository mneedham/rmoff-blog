Follow on from [setting up Publisher in a clustered environment](http://rnm1978.blogspot.com/2009/03/clustering-publisher-scheduler-and.html), I've found a nasty little bug in the scheduling element of Publisher, Quartz.  
  
Looking at the oc4j log file /opmn/logs/default\_group~home~default\_group~1.log I can see OC4J starting up, and then a whole load of repeated messages:

Metalink to the rescue .... a search for "Search: ClusterManager: Scanning for instance" throws up doc 739623.1 - Repeated Error Appears In Log File - ClusterManager: detected 1 failed or restarted instances which details the problem and references bug # 7264646. 
  
This is a bug in Quartz (the Publisher scheduling tool), which has been fixed in [1.5.2](http://wiki.opensymphony.com/display/QRTZ1/Quartz+1.5.2) (the version that's included with Publisher is 1.5.1).  
  
On my installation quartz was located in /j2ee/home/applications/xmlpserver/xmlpserver/WEB-INF/lib  
  
Implenting the fix described on Metalink doc 739623.1 solved the problem.
