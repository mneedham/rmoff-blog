Bit of an odd one this. Oracle 11g database, a user's password has expired. But when I try to change it, I can't: \[sourcecode language="bash"\] $sqlplus MYUSER/oldPW@oraDBServer

SQL\*Plus: Release 10.2.0.1.0 - Production on Wed Sep 23 07:57:41 2009

ERROR: ORA-28001: the password has expired

Changing password for MYUSER New password: Retype new password: ERROR: ORA-01017: invalid username/password; logon denied

Password unchanged \[/sourcecode\]

After a bit of digging around I found [a post](http://www.experts-exchange.com/Database/Oracle/Q_24264349.html) ([cached](http://209.85.229.132/search?q=cache:hqJIemZFzTgJ:www.experts-exchange.com/Database/Oracle/Q_24264349.html+ora+expired+sqlplus+28001+01017&cd=1&hl=en&ct=clnk)) which says that this is a problem when you use 10g clients with 11g database. And sure enough:

\[sourcecode language="bash"\] C:\\Windows\\System32>C:\\instantclient\_11\_1\\sqlplus.exe MYUSER/oldPW@oraDBServer
