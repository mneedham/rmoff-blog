Poking around on My Oracle Support today, I found a link to a white paper dated November 2010, titled "Best Practices for a Data Warehouse on Oracle Database 11g". It's new to me and I've not noticed a blog post announcing it, so I thought I'd share it here. It's by Maria Colgan, who has posted in the past on both the [Inside the Oracle Optimizer](http://blogs.oracle.com/optimizer/) blog and [The Data Warehouse Insider](http://blogs.oracle.com/datawarehousing/) blog. Here's the link to it:

- **[Best Practices for a Data Warehouse on Oracle Database 11g](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/database/features/bi-datawarehousing/twp-dw-best-practies-11g11-2008-09-132076.pdf)**

I found the link via [Exadata V2 Starter Kit (Doc ID 1244344.1)](https://supporthtml.oracle.com/ep/faces/secure/km/DocumentDisplay.jspx?id=1244344.1&h=Y#_Toc275346986). There wasn't one in my stocking from Santa this year, but I can dream ;-) The doc has some other useful links including ones like the above white paper which are not solely Exadata related.
