Here's a set of scripts that I use on our servers as a quick way to check if the various BI components are up and running.

![areservicesrunning](/images/rnm1978/areservicesrunning2.png "areservicesrunning")

Because we split the stack across servers, there are different scripts called in combination. On our dev boxes we have everything and so the script calls all three sub-scripts, whereas on Production each server will run one of:

1. BI Server
2. Presentation Server & OAS
3. Informatica & DAC

The scripts source another script called process\_check.sh which I based on the common.sh script that comes with OBIEE.

The BI Server script includes logic to only check for the cluster controller if it's running on a known clustered machine. This is because in our development environment we don't cluster the BI Server.

Each script details where the log files and config files can be found, obviously for your installation these will vary. I should have used variables for these, but hey, what's a hacky script if not imperfect :-)

The script was written and tested on HP-UX.

## Installation

Copy each of these onto your server in the same folder.

You might need to add that folder to your PATH.

Edit are\_processes\_running.sh so that it calls the appropriate scripts for the components you have installed.

You shouldn't need to edit any of the other scripts except to update log and config paths.

## The scripts

\# Comment out the scripts that are not required # For example if there is no ETL on this server then only # run the first two scripts \_are\_BI\_processes\_running.sh \_are\_PS\_processes\_running.sh \_are\_INF\_processes\_running.sh
