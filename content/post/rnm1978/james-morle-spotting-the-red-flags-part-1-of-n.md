A [new blog from James Morle](http://jamesmorle.wordpress.com/), who I don't know but from other bloggers sounds well respected, and describes himself thus:

> _Since it’s been nearly ten years since I wrote my book,_ [_Scaling Oracle8i_](http://cseng.aw.com/catalog/academic/product/0,1144,0201325748-TOC,00.html)_, I thought it was about time that I started writing again. I thought I would start with the new-fangled blogging thing, and see where it takes me. Here goes._

He's got a really interesting post on "red flags" to look for in diagnosing performance problems in Oracle: [Spotting the Red Flags (Part 1 of n)](http://jamesmorle.wordpress.com/2009/09/24/spotting-the-red-flags-part-1-of-n/).
