The latest point release of Oracle Business Intelligence Applications, 7.9.6.1, has been released and is available for download [from here](http://www.oracle.com/technology/software/products/ias/htdocs/101320bi.html) ([direct link to download](http://download.oracle.com/otn/nt/bi/biapps_windows_7961.zip)).

The version.txt reports the version as:

> Build: 7.9.6.1.100609.2038 Release Version: Oracle Business Intelligence Applications 7.9.6.1 Package: 100609.2038

No updated [documentation library](http://www.oracle.com/technology/documentation/bi_apps.html) yet through, so can't nosey through the release notes. The docs that come with the download are labelled 7.9.6 and dated April 09 so don't look like they've been updated either.

Update 13th Oct: [@alex has got the scoop on the new functionality](http://siebel-essentials.blogspot.com/2009/10/oracle-business-intelligence.html). From this and the [press release](http://www.oracle.com/us/corporate/press/036669?rssid=rss_ocom_pr) here's a few snippets:

- 28 supported languages
- \[...\] ideal for data warehouses running on the Sun Oracle Database Machine.
    - So I assume this means that it supports 11gR2 whether Exadata'd or not?
- "adds support for Informatica PowerCenter 8.6.1 for ETL"
- More supported DBs and OSs: IBM DB2 9.5 / Microsoft SQL Server 2008 / Teradata v13 / OEL 5 / IBM AIX 6.1 / Windows Server 2008 / RH Linux 5

Still no updated documentation on OTN. Never let it be said that the documentation lets OBIA down .... :-| -------------- Update 15th Oct: [Documentation is now available on OTN](http://download.oracle.com/docs/cd/E14847_01/index.htm)
