I noticed on [Nico's wiki](http://gerardnico.com/wiki/dat/obiee/) (which is amazing by the way, it has **so** much information in it) a [bunch of additional parameters for nqcmd](http://gerardnico.com/wiki/dat/obiee/nqcmd) other than those which are displayed in the default helptext (nqcmd -h).

These are the additional ones: \[sourcecode\] -b<super batch file name> -w<# wait seconds> -c<# cancel interval seconds> -n<# number of loops> -r<# number of requests per shared session> -t<# number of threads> -T (a flag to turn on time statistics) -SmartDiff (a flag to enable SmartDiff tags in output) -P<the percent of statements to disable cache hit> -impersonate <the impersonate username> -runas <the runas username> \[/sourcecode\]

Most parameters don't appear to work in default call of nqcmd in 10g and 11g, throwing a **Argument error near:** error. \[sourcecode\] -b<super batch file name> -w<# wait seconds> -c<# cancel interval seconds> -n<# number of loops> -r<# number of requests per shared session> -t<# number of threads> -P<the percent of statements to disable cache hit> -SmartDiff (a flag to enable SmartDiff tags in output) \[/sourcecode\] I wonder if there's an [Open Sesame](http://www.phrases.org.uk/bulletin_board/42/messages/1049.html) type flag that needs to be used to enable these parameters by support. Or maybe they don't even exist.

This leaves this handful of additional parameters which do work (/don't throw an error) in the default invocation of nqcmd: \[sourcecode\] -T (a flag to turn on time statistics) -impersonate <the impersonate username> -runas <the runas username> \[/sourcecode\]

Oracle Support directed me to [the documentation](http://download.oracle.com/docs/cd/E21764_01/bi.1111/e10540.pdf) (Table 14-1), but this covers the standard parameters, not these extra ones.

**Oracle Support also pointed out that undocumented parameters are not supported except under direct instruction**

The -T flag looks very useful for [performance testing](/2010/05/24/performance-testing-and-obiee/) purposes, as it appends this information to the output from nqcmd: \[sourcecode\] Clock time: batch start: 15:44:32.000 Query from: 15:44:32.000 to: 15:44:59.000 Row count: 0 total: 27 prepare: 1 execute: 26 fetch: 0 Cumulative time(seconds): Batch elapsed: 26 Query total: 27 prepare: 1, execute: 26, fetch: 0, query count: 1, cumulative rows: 0 \[/sourcecode\]

I'm intrigued to know where Nico got his list from (he couldn't remember when I asked him :-)). Has anyone else come across these and/or know what they do and how to invoke them? Stuff like SmartDiff sounds tantalisingly interesting.
