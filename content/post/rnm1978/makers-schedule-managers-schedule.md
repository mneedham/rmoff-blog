I found this post very interesting: [Paul Graham : Maker's Schedule, Manager's Schedule](http://www.paulgraham.com/makersschedule.html) (originally found [here](http://rc3.org/2009/07/24/makers-schedule-versus-managers-schedule/))  
  
It was one of those mini-revelations when I found something that greatly resonated and explained an inexplicable frustration I find in the workplace sometimes.  
  
I wonder how applicable it can be to a large corporation though, rather than a start-up where it's given that people are allowed to be [bolshy](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=bolshy) with their meetings? ;-)
