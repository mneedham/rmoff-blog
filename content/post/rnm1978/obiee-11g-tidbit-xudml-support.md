Spotted this when trawling through My Oracle Support. It's pretty common knowledge anyway amongst people already familiar with hacking around with OBIEE, but worth recording for people coming along to it new.

[Doc ID 1068266.1](https://supporthtml.oracle.com/ep/faces/secure/km/DocumentDisplay.jspx?id=1068266.1) states:

> UDML is not supported in OBI 10g.
> 
> in 11g, XUDML (the Oracle BI Server XML API) will be fully supported and documented.
