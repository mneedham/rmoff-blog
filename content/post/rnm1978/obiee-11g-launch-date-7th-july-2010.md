OBIEE 11g is going to be officially launched on 7th July (this year!) in London: [Launch Event: Introducing Oracle Business Intelligence Enterprise Edition 11g](http://www.oracle.com/webapps/events/EventsDetail.jsp?p_eventId=113706&src=7036704&src=7036704&Act=9)

h/t to [Twitter](http://www.google.co.uk/search?q=obiee+11g&num=30&hl=en&safe=off&client=firefox-a&hs=ohQ&rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&prmd=v&source=lnms&tbs=mbl:1&ei=5WEHTP6JI5P00gS9rqVp&sa=X&oi=mode_link&ct=mode&ved=0CBUQ_AU&prmdo=1) and [blogs](http://blogs.oracle.com/bi/2010/06/into_orbit_obiee_11g_launch.html) (including an Oracle-branded one) this morning. Good news travels fast! :-)

Looks like John Minkjan won [the bet](http://obiee101.blogspot.com/p/obiee-11g-ga-bet.html), did he know something we didn't? ;-) (although is "Launch" the same as "GA"?)
