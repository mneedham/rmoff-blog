Oracle XE 11gR2 beta has just been released, some [details here](http://technology.amis.nl/blog/11785/oracle-xe-11gr2-the-free-express-edition-for-oracle-database-11gr2) and [download here](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/database/express-edition/11gxe-beta-download-302519.html). It's not a great deal of use for sandboxing DWH-specific stuff, given this list of **excluded** functionality (and this is by no means everything that's not included):

> - Bitmapped index, bitmapped join index, and bitmap plan conversions
> - Oracle Partitioning
> - Parallel Data Pump Export/Import
> - Parallel query/DML
> - Parallel Statement Queuing
> 
> ([source](http://download.oracle.com/docs/cd/E17781_01/license.112/e18068/toc.htm#BABJBGGA))

However, it's always interesting to have to hand for trying out other things. And I like playing with new toys :)

On running the installer, I hit this problem: ![](/images/rnm1978/snag-2011-04-04-08-47-32-0000.png "SNAG-2011-04-04-08.47.32-0000")

The previous owner of the machine had installed Oracle XE 10, but I'd removed this: ![](/images/rnm1978/snag-2011-04-04-08-53-31-0000.png "SNAG-2011-04-04-08.53.31-0000")

Or so I thought: ![](/images/rnm1978/snag-2011-04-04-08-57-25-0000.png "SNAG-2011-04-04-08.57.25-0000")

To remove the service entry, use the [sc command](http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc742045(WS.10).aspx): \[sourcecode\] sc delete OracleServiceXE \[/sourcecode\]

For good measure I did the same for OracleJobSchedulerXE. ![](/images/rnm1978/snag-2011-04-04-09-00-47-0000.png "SNAG-2011-04-04-09.00.47-0000")

After this, installation proceeded as normal.
