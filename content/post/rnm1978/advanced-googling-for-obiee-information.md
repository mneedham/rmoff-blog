Want to find all PDFs from Oracle about OBIEE?

[![site-.oracle.com filetype-pdf obiee - Google Search_1257257786312](/images/rnm1978/site-oracle-com-filetype-pdf-obiee-google-search_1257257786312.png)](http://www.google.com/search?q=site%3A.oracle.com+filetype%3Apdf+obiee)

There's some interesting ones that this turned up on Oracle's public FTP. In particular:

- [BI EE Environmental and Multi-User Development Migration Processes](ftp://ftp.oracle.com/sales/outgoing/bwise/config/BI%20EE%20SCM,%20Merge%20and%20Migration.pdf "BI EE Environmental and Multi-User Development Migration Processes")
- [Securing Oracle BI Enterprise Edition](ftp://ftp.oracle.com/sales/outgoing/bwise/security/Securing%20Oracle%20BI%20distro.pdf)

(There's also PowerPoint files on there including [this one](ftp://ftp.oracle.com/sales/outgoing/bwise/pnnl/BIEE%20Environmental%20and%20Multi-User%20Development%20Migration.ppt) but Google doesn't seem to index them)

You can use [Google's Advanced Search page](http://www.google.co.uk/advanced_search) to build similar queries:

You can also use [Google Alerts](http://alerts.google.com) so that any time a new entry matching your search criteria is added in Google's index you get notified of it either by email or on an RSS feed:

Google Is Your Friend, and powerful ally :-D
