Another way of keeping up with what's going on in the obiee world, add [this RSS feed](http://feeds.delicious.com/v2/rss/tag/obiee?count=15) of del.icio.us obiee tags to your reader. It may be less "current" (because people might discover and bookmark 'old' pages), but it's another tool in the armoury :)

If you want an aggregated RSS feed of OBIEE / Oracle related blog postings [try this one](http://www.google.com/reader/public/atom/user%2F13728252801323748997%2Flabel%2FOracle).
