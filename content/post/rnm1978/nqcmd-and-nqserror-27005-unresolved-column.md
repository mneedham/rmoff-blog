I'm working on a scripted load test for OBIEE using nqcmd to run reports multiple times. I hit this interesting issue.  
  
Cut and pasting the logical SQL that Presentation Services sends to BI Server from Manage Sessions -> Statement, I kept getting this error when I ran it through nqcmd:  
  

> \[10058\]\[State: S1000\] \[NQODBC\] \[SQL\_STATE: S1000\] \[nQSError: 10058\] A general error has occurred.  
> \[nQSError: 27005\] Unresolved column: "Natural Account (COA)"."Account Parent1 Code".  
> Statement preparation failed  

  
Eventually I tracked it down after looking at the logical SQL behind the report in Answers itself and comparing it to what I'd copied out of the Session statement:  
  
SELECT "Natural Account (COA)"."Account Parent1 Code" saw\_0, "Natural Account (COA)"."Account Parent5 Code"  \[...\]  
SELECT "Natural Account  (COA)"."Account Parent1 Code" saw\_0, "Natural Account  (COA)"."Account Parent5 Cod \[...\]  
  
  
  
The "Natual Account (COA)" prefix had two spaces in it, but because I was copying it out of a web browser where multiple spaces are rendered as single unless escaped, the supposedly verbatim copy wasn't such.  
  
More details of the load testing script to follow...
