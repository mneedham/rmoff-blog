There is a LOT written about performance. And this post is now adding to it. Some of it's excellent, some of it less so. But a lot of it starts from a point so far down the process that unless you know the first bit, you're going to raring off and end up chasing your tail or p###ing in the wind.... (pardon my french). Without a well structured approach that you understand and always follow you'll hit on solutions by luck only.

So seriously, unless you really know what you're doing when it comes to computer systems and performance you should read these articles by Cary Millsap. They're well written and easy to follow without losing any of their point, depth or value. Heck, even if you do know what you're doing then read them anyway and appreciate the clear and eloquent language.
