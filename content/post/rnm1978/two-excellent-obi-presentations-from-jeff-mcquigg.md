Jeff McQuigg has posted two presentations that he gave at Openworld 2010 on his website here: [http://greatobi.wordpress.com/2010/10/26/oow-presos/](http://greatobi.wordpress.com/2010/10/26/oow-presos/)

They're full of real content and well worth a read. There's excellent levels of detail and plenty to think about if you're involved in OBI or DW development projects.
