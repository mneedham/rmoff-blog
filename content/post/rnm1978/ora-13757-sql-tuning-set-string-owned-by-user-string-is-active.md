I've been playing around with [SQL Tuning Sets](http://download.oracle.com/docs/cd/B28359_01/server.111/b28274/sql_tune.htm#i34915), and was trying to clear up my mess.

To list all the tuning sets: \[sourcecode language="sql"\] SET WRAP OFF SET LINE 140 COL NAME FOR A15 COL DESCRIPTION FOR A50 WRAPPED

select name,created,last\_modified,statement\_count,description from DBA\_SQLSET \[/sourcecode\]

\[sourcecode\] NAME CREATED LAST\_MODI STATEMENT\_COUNT DESCRIPTION --------------- --------- --------- --------------- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- sts\_test\_02 09-MAR-10 09-MAR-10 1 Test run 1 sts\_test\_01 12-FEB-10 12-FEB-10 1 an old STS test test test \[/sourcecode\]

To delete a tuning set: \[sourcecode language="sql"\] BEGIN DBMS\_SQLTUNE.DROP\_SQLSET(sqlset\_name => 'sts\_test\_01'); END; \[/sourcecode\]

But you may hit this message:

> ORA-13757: "SQL Tuning Set" "string" owned by user "string" is active. Cause: The user attempted to update an active SQL Tuning Set. Action: Remove all reference to the SQL Tuning Set and retry the operation.

For example: **ORA-13757: "SQL Tuning Set" "sts\_test\_01" owned by user "badger" is active.**

[Error code reference](http://download.oracle.com/docs/cd/B19306_01/server.102/b14219/e12700.htm)

To look up why the STS is considered active, check the [SQL Tuning Information Views](http://download.oracle.com/docs/cd/B28359_01/server.111/b28274/sql_tune.htm#i35947), in this case DBA\_SQLSET\_REFERENCES

\[sourcecode language="sql"\] SET WRAP OFF SET LINE 140 COL NAME FOR A15 COL DESCRIPTION FOR A50 WRAPPED

select description, created, owner from DBA\_SQLSET\_REFERENCES where sqlset\_name = 'sts\_test\_01'; \[/sourcecode\]

which in my case showed this: \[sourcecode\] DESCRIPTION CREATED OWNER -------------------------------------------------- --------- ------------------------------ created by: SQL Tuning Advisor - task: RNM\_TT 12-FEB-10 badger \[/sourcecode\]

So we check for this on DBA\_ADVISOR\_TASKS: \[sourcecode language="sql"\] SET WRAP OFF SET LINE 140 COL NAME FOR A15 COL OWNER FOR A10 COL DESCRIPTION FOR A50 WRAPPED

select owner,description, created,last\_modified from DBA\_ADVISOR\_TASKS where task\_name = 'RNM\_TT' \[/sourcecode\]

and it shows this: \[sourcecode\] OWNER DESCRIPTION CREATED LAST\_MODI ---------- -------------------------------------------------- --------- --------- badger SQL Advisor - sts\_test\_01 12-FEB-10 12-FEB-10 \[/sourcecode\]

So now we know it's a stale SQL Tuning Advisor task that uses the SQL Tuning Set, and I definitely want to delete it:

\[sourcecode language="sql"\] BEGIN DBMS\_SQLTUNE.DROP\_TUNING\_TASK(task\_name => 'RNM\_TT'); END; \[/sourcecode\]

and then I can delete my original SQL Tuning Set:

\[sourcecode language="sql"\] BEGIN DBMS\_SQLTUNE.DROP\_SQLSET(sqlset\_name => 'sts\_test\_01'); END; \[/sourcecode\]

All done :)
