## Introduction

We're in the process of implemention [Resource Manager](http://download.oracle.com/docs/cd/B28359_01/server.111/b28310/dbrm.htm#i1010776) (RM) on our Oracle 11gR1 Data Warehouse. We've currently got one DW application live, but have several more imminent. We identified RM as a suitable way of - as the name would suggest - managing the resources on the server.

In the first instance we're looking at simply protecting CPU for, and from, future applications. At some point it would be interesting to use some of the more granular and precise functions to demote long-running queries, have nighttime/daytime plans, etc. I'd also like to explore the [management of IO](http://www.oracle-base.com/articles/11g/ResourceManagerEnhancements_11gR1.php#per_session_io_limits) but for us the pain is in bandwidth that a query consumes, and it looks like RM can only work with total session MB, or IOPS. Reading about Exadata it sounds like the Exadata I/O Resource Management might do this (\[...\][It allows intra and inter-database I/O bandwidth to be defined and managed](http://blogs.sun.com/Samson/entry/oracle_exadata_storage_server_a)\[..\]). But for that I'll have to write to Santa and promise to be a good boy this year.

Here are some good resources for learning about Resource Manager:

## Our implementation of RM

Our initial aim with RM is to do nothing more than ensure that everything we need to run does not do so at the expense of other applications on the server. A 64-way parallel beast of a query should not be allowed to freeze out lightweight workload from application backend processes (such as Usage Tracking, Informatica and DAC Repositories, etc).

We've implemented this by grouping schema IDs from the four projects into consumer groups (PROJ\_A\_GRP, PROJ\_B\_GRP, PROJ\_C\_GRP, PROJ\_D\_GRP). The other group where users are explicitly defined is SYS\_GROUP, for the SYS and SYSTEM users. All other users (i.e. those from application backend processes) go in the OTHER\_GROUP.

Our Resource Plan is this: CPU priority is allocated entirely to SYSTEM\_GROUP. If any is remaining, it is allocated to OTHER\_GROUP. Any CPU remaining after that gets divided up in quarters to the four project groups. It's worth pointing out that Oracle itself manages Oracle core processes, in a group called \_ORACLE\_BACKGROUND\_GROUP\_.

Here's the contents of V$RSRC\_PLAN, DBA\_RSRC\_PLANS, and DBA\_RSRC\_PLAN\_DIRECTIVES for the current active plan: \[sourcecode\] ID NAME IS\_TOP\_PLAN CPU\_MANAGED ---------- -------------------------------- ----------- ----------- 1020578 DW\_PLAN TRUE ON

\[/sourcecode\]

My understanding of RM's control of CPU is that in essence it does nothing, until the database is under CPU pressures. Once queries are being constrained by CPU, RM will enforce the allocation of CPU between the various consumer groups as defined in the currently active Resource Plan.

Note that RM is only within the Oracle context - it cannot do anything about non-Oracle processes on the same server using lots of CPU. An example of this that we've seen is ODI agents running local to the database - if these are doing lots of work then they may impact Oracle but we cannot use RM to control it.

Here's my understanding of how we'll see RM in action - and as you'll see from the tests that I run, I'm not sure that it is entirely correct. Generally, there will be no SYSTEM\_GROUP activity, and very minimal OTHER\_GROUP activity. This leaves the lion's share for our application queries/ETL. Until the CPU on the box hits 100%, no throttling will be done. This is important to note. Our allocation of 25% CPU to PROJ\_A\_GRP only means that it is the minimum it can expect (see below - this doesn't seem to be correct). If nothing else is running, it will get 100%. Conversely, if an application backend process (in the OTHER\_GROUP consumer group) is using lots of CPU, let's say 60%, and all four project groups are demanding CPU, then each will get 25% of the remaining 40% of the box's capacity, i.e. 10% host CPU.

## Scripts to Monitor and Test RM

It's important to know that RM is doing what we think it is, and to also be able to determine the current state of a system in terms of resources. If a system is at 100% CPU and users are demanding why RM "isn't working" it will be useful to prove that it is non-Oracle processes creating the CPU demand.

I've been working on some queries to both validate and monitor RM. [This excellent whitepaper on RM](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/database/features/performance/resource-manager-twp-133705.pdf) has some queries illustrating how to use [v$rsrcmgrmetric\_history](http://download.oracle.com/docs/cd/B28359_01/server.111/b28320/dynviews_2155.htm#REFRN30483) to report on RM behaviour. I built on this to incorporate [V$SYSMETRIC\_HISTORY](http://download.oracle.com/docs/cd/B28359_01/server.111/b28320/dynviews_3084.htm#I1030344) to source host CPU %, creating this query which infers the workload on the system.

We're looking at system statistics per minute slice (which is the level that v$rsrcmgrmetric\_history is at, and then GROUP\_ID=2 on V$SYSMETRIC\_HISTORY).

The source metrics are :

- **CPU count** - From v$osstat where stat\_name = 'NUM\_CPUS'.
- **Host CPU utilisation (%)** - From V$SYSMETRIC\_HISTORY where metric\_id = 2057. This number should match the CPU usage as reported by the host (e.g. through sar, top, glance etc)
- **Used Oracle Seconds** - From V$RSRCMGRMETRIC\_HISTORY.cpu\_consumed\_time. The number of CPU seconds that Oracle thinks it has consumed

From this are derived:

- **Total Available CPU Seconds** - The number of CPU seconds per minute slice available is going to be 60 seconds multiplied by the number of CPUs that in theory could be running Oracle work. Obviously in practice Oracle can't use 100% of this CPU time, but this number's a useful starting point for the following derivations
- **Total Used Seconds** - Total CPU time, divided by the host CPU utilisation. So if the CPU is at 50% utilisation and there are 480 CPU seconds available per minute, then logically 240 CPU seconds must have been used over that minute. Note that this is the total number of CPU seconds used, both Oracle and Non-Oracle.
- **Non-Oracle Seconds Used** - Total CPU time, divided by the host CPU utilisation, minus the number of CPU seconds Oracle has used.

From the above derived figures percentages are calculated too.

\[sourcecode\] Total Available Used Oracle Used Host BEGIN\_TIME CPU Seconds Seconds CPU % ------------------- --------------- ----------- --------- 2010-09-10 21:52:50 480 0.1 1.6 2010-09-10 21:53:50 480 0.2 1.3 2010-09-10 21:54:50 480 140.2 32.6 2010-09-10 21:55:50 480 177.9 41.1 2010-09-10 21:56:50 480 174.9 42.1 2010-09-10 21:57:50 480 177.6 40.4 2010-09-10 21:58:50 480 174.8 39.6 2010-09-10 21:59:50 480 189.0 43.0 2010-09-10 22:00:50 480 177.7 40.0 2010-09-10 22:01:50 480 174.5 42.2 2010-09-10 22:02:50 480 178.0 40.8 2010-09-10 22:03:51 480 180.8 41.3 2010-09-10 22:04:50 480 12.3 4.0 2010-09-10 22:05:50 480 0.1 1.7 2010-09-10 22:06:50 480 0.2 1.8 \[/sourcecode\]

## Test 03

The next test I ran used the hit\_cpu script and was called once from a user in one each of the four consumer groups, plus a user not allocated a consumer group and therefore in OTHER\_GROUP. Five scripts in total, so should expect to see CPU usage around (5 x c.60) = c.300 seconds, and machine CPU at something like (5/8)\*100 so c.60-70%

Test started at 2010-09-10 16:20:20. CPU immediately hit about 64% - which based on my calculation above was satisfying :-)

Using rm\_05 (see above), the breakdown of Oracle CPU time could be seen:

\[sourcecode\] Total Available Used Oracle Throttled TIME CONSUMER\_GROUP\_NAME CPU Seconds Oracle Seconds % of Host CPU Time (s) ------------------- ------------------------------ --------------- -------------- ------------------ ---------------- 2010-10-09 16:20:50 PROJ\_C\_GRP 480 58.2 12.1 0.0 PROJ\_A\_GRP 480 58.2 12.1 0.0 PROJ\_B\_GRP 480 58.2 12.1 0.0 OTHER\_GROUPS 480 58.8 12.3 0.0 PROJ\_D\_GRP 480 58.4 12.2 0.0 SYS\_GROUP 480 0.0 0.0 0.0 \_ORACLE\_BACKGROUND\_GROUP\_ 480 0.0 0.0 0.0 \[/sourcecode\]

rm\_cpu\_01 showed Oracle using c.290 CPU seconds per minute (again inline with estimate - yeah!), and this time the Host CPU % looked accurate: \[sourcecode\] Total Available Used Oracle Used Host Oracle Throttled BEGIN\_TIME CPU Seconds Seconds CPU % Time (s) ------------------- --------------- ----------- --------- ---------------- 2010-09-10 16:20:50 480 291.9 66.1 0.0 2010-09-10 16:21:50 480 291.5 65.0 0.0 \[/sourcecode\]

sar matched up : \[sourcecode\] %usr %sys %wio %idle 16:21:47 65 2 0 34 16:22:47 64 1 0 35 \[/sourcecode\] (note that sar's timestamp is the END of a sample, whereas the BEGIN\_TIME in my Oracle queries is the BEGINNING of a sample)

## Test 04

Having seen that RM is correctly assigning our different users to the appropriate consumer groups, we can start testing how RM behaves once the host CPU hits capacity and RM has to start throttling its allocation to the groups.

In theory eight instances of the script should be enough to load the CPU entirely (since there are eight CPUs on the server). I ran four as a user from PROJ\_B\_GRP and four from PROJ\_A\_GRP, starting at 2010-09-10 18:27:53

As predicated CPU usage hits about 100%, according to sar: \[sourcecode\] %usr %sys %wio %idle 18:27:38 2 1 0 97 18:28:38 69 2 0 29 18:29:38 92 1 0 7 18:30:38 99 1 0 0 18:31:38 96 1 0 3 18:32:38 99 1 0 0 18:33:38 96 1 0 3 \[/sourcecode\]

and this is reflected by Oracle too (rm\_cpu\_01): \[sourcecode\] Total Available Used Oracle Used Host Oracle Throttled BEGIN\_TIME CPU Seconds Seconds CPU % Time (s) ------------------- --------------- ----------- --------- ---------------- 2010-09-10 18:26:50 480 1.0 2.3 0.0 2010-09-10 18:27:51 480 444.2 89.5 8.8 2010-09-10 18:28:50 480 472.9 95.0 0.0 2010-09-10 18:29:50 480 465.5 99.1 5.5 2010-09-10 18:30:50 480 462.1 97.0 32.2 2010-09-10 18:31:49 480 473.6 100.0 0.1 2010-09-10 18:32:50 480 458.5 95.2 24.7 \[/sourcecode\]

We can see that of the 480 CPU seconds available in every minute slice, Oracle is using almost all of it - around 470 seconds.

Looking at Resource Manager, we can see that it kicks in - in the time slice beginning at 18:30:50, Oracle constrained one or some of the queries by a total of 30 seconds. Using rm\_02 we can see how this divides up among the sessions. "CPU Wait Time (s)" corresponds to the "Oracle Throttled Time (s)" in rm\_cpu\_01 and rm\_05(bearing in mind different levels of granularity since one is per minute / consumer group and one is per session total). \[sourcecode\] Consumer CPU Wait CPU CPU time I/O time Group SID USERNAME STATE Yields Time (s) Waits (s) (s) OSUSER PROGRAM MACHINE EVENT ----------- ----- ---------------- ---------- ------ -------- ------ --------- -------- -------- ------------ ---------------- ---------------------------- PROJ\_A\_GRP 1094 PROJA\_USR RUNNING 61 2 61 960.5 .0 myuser0 sqlplus@aser aserver resmgr:cpu quantum PROJ\_A\_GRP 553 PROJA\_USR RUNNING 302 16 302 946.8 .0 myuser0 sqlplus@aser aserver latch free PROJ\_A\_GRP 498 PROJA\_USR RUNNING 310 19 310 945.2 .0 myuser0 sqlplus@aser aserver latch free PROJ\_A\_GRP 1089 PROJA\_USR RUNNING 61 3 61 960.5 .0 myuser0 sqlplus@aser aserver resmgr:cpu quantum PROJ\_B\_GRP 1078 PROJB\_USR RUNNING 56 4 56 959.5 .0 myuser0 sqlplus@aser aserver latch free PROJ\_B\_GRP 523 PROJB\_USR RUNNING 301 17 301 946.7 .0 myuser0 sqlplus@aser aserver latch free PROJ\_B\_GRP 508 PROJB\_USR RUNNING 290 19 290 945.1 .0 myuser0 sqlplus@aser aserver latch free PROJ\_B\_GRP 1090 PROJB\_USR RUNNING 61 3 61 960.4 .0 myuser0 sqlplus@aser aserver latch free \[/sourcecode\]

and aggregated to consumer group level (script rm\_05): \[sourcecode\] Total Available Used Oracle Throttled TIME CONSUMER\_GROUP\_NAME CPU Seconds Oracle Seconds % of Host CPU Time (s) ------------------- ------------------------------ --------------- -------------- ------------------ ---------------- 2010-10-09 18:30:50 PROJ\_C\_GRP 480 0.0 0.0 0.0 PROJ\_A\_GRP 480 217.7 45.4 13.1 PROJ\_B\_GRP 480 215.8 45.0 15.0 OTHER\_GROUPS 480 28.6 6.0 4.1 PROJ\_D\_GRP 480 0.0 0.0 0.0 SYS\_GROUP 480 0.0 0.0 0.0 \_ORACLE\_BACKGROUND\_GROUP\_ 480 0.0 0.0 0.0 \[/sourcecode\]

Note that the throttling is applied pretty much equally to both consumer groups. In plan terms, CPU for level 1 (100% to SYS\_GROUP) is unused, so passes to level 2 (100% to OTHER\_GROUP). OTHER\_GROUP consumes a small amount, and note that it is not \[really\] throttled. The remaining CPU (96%, from rm\_cpu\_01, minus 6% shown in rm\_05 output = c.90%), is passed onto level 3 of the plan. Whilst the four projects are defined an allocation of 25% each in the plan, two of the consumer groups are not consuming their chunk, so it is divided up amongst the groups that are, according to the ratio of their allocations. Hence, PROJ\_A\_GRP and PROJ\_B\_GRP are using c.45% of host CPU. **N.B.** see below for discussion around allocation of CPU, as this statement about ratio may not be true.

## Test 05

Test 04 above showed that RM applies throttling evenly to consumer groups, but it could have been influenced by an equal number of sessions for each consumer group running (that is, if it had throttled in a round-robin manner the result could have been the same).

This test will run a similar workload, but with a skewed number of sessions; 1 PROJ\_A\_GRP and 7 PROJ\_B\_GRP.

The test began at 2010-09-10 19:03:22.

Total CPU usage is about 84%, which on an eight-CPU box is c.1 CPU unused.

So - PROJ\_A\_GRP is getting all the CPU that it needs (since it is shown as having zero CPU Wait Time (rm\_02) and zero throttled time (rm\_05). The session is also shown (in rm\_05) as consuming almost 60 CPU seconds in a 60 second time slice.

The PROJ\_B\_GRP has two sessions that apparently run unconstrained, and five that are throttled by RM. The output from rm\_cpu\_01 above shows that RM throttles the queries by roughly 80 seconds of CPU time per minute. Over five sessions (and rm\_02 above shows the constraining being applied equally) that equates to c.16 seconds of CPU time per session.

Even once the first queries complete c.19:17 and the CPU usage drops further, RM still appears to throttle the PROJ\_B\_GRP queries.

**So here is my first major puzzlement with RM:**

- I would have expected to see all seven PROJ\_B\_GRP sessions constrained at the same rate.
- Why were the PROJ\_B\_GRP queries throttled even when there was idle CPU? From 19:17 onwards there was around 35% idle.

FWIW the scripts were started from a shell script similar to above, with the PROJ\_B\_GRP sessions first, and then PROJ\_A\_GRP session.

## Test 06

In Test 05 PROJ\_A\_GRP was running only one process, so would not be demanding as much or more than its theoretical 25% allocation. This test will run three PROJ\_A\_GRP sessions and which would (based on Test 02 above) require c.36% host CPU to run. In addition I will run six PROJ\_B\_GRP sessions, theoretical CPU requirement of c.72% host CPU. The total CPU should be driven above 100% and RM kick in.

My understanding (which could be wrong) of RM is that it will do as it did above when there were equal numbers of sessions in each consumer group to throttle; it will allocate the resource 50:50 to the two consumer groups, even though the ratio of sessions will be 1:2.

The test started at 2010-09-10 19:43:51. The results were different from what I had expected.

CPU didn't hit 100%, staying around 85%. Overall it looked like this (rm\_cpu\_01): \[sourcecode\] Total Available Used Oracle Used Host Oracle Throttled BEGIN\_TIME CPU Seconds Seconds CPU % Time (s) ------------------- --------------- ----------- --------- ---------------- 2010-09-10 19:40:50 480 0.4 0.9 0.0 2010-09-10 19:41:50 480 0.2 1.1 0.0 2010-09-10 19:42:50 480 2.5 3.8 0.1 2010-09-10 19:43:51 480 424.7 85.5 101.6 2010-09-10 19:44:50 480 420.0 84.4 101.3 2010-09-10 19:45:50 480 422.6 84.1 105.7 2010-09-10 19:46:50 480 423.4 84.0 106.7 2010-09-10 19:47:50 480 425.3 83.2 107.4 \[/sourcecode\]

sar reports pretty much the same cpu (the figure of 68% here is because of the time at which the test started versus the point in the minute at which sar is recording from): \[sourcecode\] %usr %sys %wio %idle 19:41:38 1 1 0 99 19:42:38 1 1 0 98 19:43:38 1 1 0 98 19:44:38 68 1 0 31 19:45:38 85 1 0 14 19:46:38 84 1 0 15 19:47:38 83 1 0 17 19:48:38 83 1 0 16 \[/sourcecode\]

RM throttled both consumer groups - but by a different amount to what I had expected. Taking a minute slice (and all were almost the same) using rm\_05: \[sourcecode\] Total Available Used Oracle Throttled TIME CONSUMER\_GROUP\_NAME CPU Seconds Oracle Seconds % of Host CPU Time (s) ------------------- ------------------------------ --------------- -------------- ------------- ---------------- 2010-10-09 19:44:50 PROJ\_C\_GRP 480 0.0 0.0 0.0 PROJ\_A\_GRP 480 135.2 28.2 38.4 PROJ\_B\_GRP 480 284.7 59.3 62.8 OTHER\_GROUPS 480 0.1 0.0 0.2 PROJ\_D\_GRP 480 0.0 0.0 0.0 SYS\_GROUP 480 0.0 0.0 0.0 \_ORACLE\_BACKGROUND\_GROUP\_ 480 0.0 0.0 0.0 \[/sourcecode\]

So RM appears to guarenteeing PROJ\_A\_GRP at least 25% CPU (per the resource plan), but after than it allocates twice as much CPU to PROJ\_B\_GRP

Individual sessions (rm\_02): \[sourcecode\] Consumed Consumer CPU Wait CPU CPU time I/O time Group SID USERNAME STATE Yields Time (s) Waits (s) (s) PROGRAM EVENT ----------- ----- ---------------- ---------- ------ -------- ------ --------- -------- ------------ -------------------------------------------- PROJ\_A\_GRP 508 PROJA\_USR RUNNING 1600 128 1600 255.5 .0 sqlplus@aser resmgr:cpu quantum PROJ\_A\_GRP 553 PROJA\_USR RUNNING 1599 122 1599 262.2 .0 sqlplus@aser resmgr:cpu quantum PROJ\_A\_GRP 1098 PROJA\_USR RUNNING 8 0 8 384.1 .0 sqlplus@aser resmgr:cpu quantum PROJ\_B\_GRP 1070 PROJB\_USR RUNNING 4 0 4 383.4 .0 sqlplus@aser latch free PROJ\_B\_GRP 523 PROJB\_USR WAITING FO 1844 146 1844 237.8 .0 sqlplus@aser resmgr:cpu quantum PROJ\_B\_GRP 1084 PROJB\_USR RUNNING 2 0 2 384.2 .0 sqlplus@aser resmgr:cpu quantum PROJ\_B\_GRP 496 PROJB\_USR RUNNING 1843 148 1843 236.2 .0 sqlplus@aser resmgr:cpu quantum PROJ\_B\_GRP 1075 PROJB\_USR RUNNING 0 0 0 384.4 .0 sqlplus@aser latch free PROJ\_B\_GRP 489 PROJB\_USR RUNNING 1836 146 1836 238.7 .0 sqlplus@aser resmgr:cpu quantum \[/sourcecode\]

**So here is my next puzzlement with RM:**

- Is it possible that CPU isn't hitting 100% because RM is throttling the queries _too_ much?

I suspect I'm misunderstanding something about how RM is supposed to work and/or how it is implemented to do what it does.

## Test 07

Leaving to one side my inability to explain the above observations with RM, I then wantd to add more load so that the machine would be under serious CPU pressure, and see how RM dealt with it.

I would run:

- 2 x OTHER\_GROUP sessions
- 5 x PROJ\_A\_GRP sessions
- 1 x PROJ\_B\_GRP session
- 10 x PROJ\_C\_GRP sessions
- 1 x PROJ\_D\_GRP session

I would hope to see something like this:

- OTHER\_GROUP unthrottled - c.20% CPU, leaving c.80% for the four project consumer groups (thus 20% each)
    - PROJ\_B\_GRP unthrottled - only generating load on one CPU so c.12% host CPU (leaving c.8% available for use by other consumer groups)
    - PROJ\_D\_GRP unthrottled - only generating load on one CPU so c.12% host CPU (leaving c.8% available for use by other consumer groups)
    - This leaves 56% (100 - 20 - 12 - 12) of a theoretical 100% CPU available for two consumer groups which between them require more than that. Based on the above results I would expect the 1:2 session balance to play out in CPU allocation too, so roughly:
        - PROJ\_C\_GRP throttled to c.<40%
        - PROJ\_A\_GRP throttled to c.<20%

The test began at 2010-09-10 20:21:49, taking a total of three seconds for all 17 scripts to start.

As before, CPU did not hit 100%, but instead hovered around 87%. We're quite clearly generating load sufficient to hit 100%, but RM is throttling it back. Whether it's the effect of swapping queries on and off CPU that means there's an efficiency loss, or whether RM deliberately holds it back to that level deliberately I don't know.

The total Oracle and host CPU/time looks like this: (rm\_cpu\_01): \[sourcecode\] Total Available Used Oracle Used Host Oracle Throttled BEGIN\_TIME CPU Seconds Seconds CPU % Time (s) ------------------- --------------- ----------- --------- ---------------- 2010-09-10 20:18:50 480 0.1 1.1 0.0 2010-09-10 20:19:50 480 0.1 3.1 0.0 2010-09-10 20:20:50 480 14.5 5.8 9.5 2010-09-10 20:21:51 480 421.4 88.1 675.4 2010-09-10 20:22:50 480 431.9 88.6 690.4 2010-09-10 20:23:50 480 433.6 88.7 685.5 2010-09-10 20:24:50 480 427.0 89.3 686.1 2010-09-10 20:25:50 480 424.2 89.5 683.1 \[/sourcecode\]

- PROJ\_A\_GRP gets c.25%, and is throttled
- PROJ\_B\_GRP gets c.6%, and is throttled
- PROJ\_D\_GRP gets c.6%, and is throttled

(I'm taking a slight liberty with OTHER\_GROUP and stating that it's not throttled; but relative to the other groups it isn't really)

rm\_02 shows the amount of CPU wait time each session is subject to: \[sourcecode\] Consumed Consumer CPU Wait CPU CPU time I/O time Group SID USERNAME STATE Yields Time (s) Waits (s) (s) PROGRAM EVENT ----------- ----- ---------------- ---------- ------ -------- ------ --------- -------- ------------ ------------------------------------------------------ PROJ\_C\_GRP 521 PROJC\_USR WAITING FO 954 581 954 103.0 .0 sqlplus@aser resmgr:cpu quantum PROJ\_C\_GRP 1090 PROJC\_USR RUNNING 2269 451 2269 232.6 .0 sqlplus@aser resmgr:cpu quantum PROJ\_C\_GRP 1070 PROJC\_USR WAITING FO 2254 452 2254 232.3 .0 sqlplus@aser resmgr:cpu quantum PROJ\_C\_GRP 524 PROJC\_USR WAITING FO 950 583 952 100.9 .0 sqlplus@aser resmgr:cpu quantum PROJ\_C\_GRP 486 PROJC\_USR WAITING FO 957 583 960 101.3 .0 sqlplus@aser resmgr:cpu quantum PROJ\_C\_GRP 512 PROJC\_USR WAITING FO 958 582 961 102.4 .0 sqlplus@aser resmgr:cpu quantum PROJ\_C\_GRP 496 PROJC\_USR WAITING FO 960 581 960 103.6 .0 sqlplus@aser resmgr:cpu quantum PROJ\_C\_GRP 1098 PROJC\_USR WAITING FO 2263 451 2263 233.9 .0 sqlplus@aser resmgr:cpu quantum PROJ\_C\_GRP 508 PROJC\_USR WAITING FO 954 581 954 104.0 .0 sqlplus@aser resmgr:cpu quantum PROJ\_C\_GRP 1082 PROJC\_USR RUNNING 2272 451 2272 234.1 .0 sqlplus@aser resmgr:cpu quantum PROJ\_A\_GRP 499 PROJA\_USR WAITING FO 2314 451 2315 233.2 .0 sqlplus@aser resmgr:cpu quantum PROJ\_A\_GRP 509 PROJA\_USR RUNNING 2296 449 2296 235.3 .0 sqlplus@aser resmgr:cpu quantum PROJ\_A\_GRP 1084 PROJA\_USR RUNNING 2138 263 2138 422.0 .0 sqlplus@aser latch free PROJ\_A\_GRP 553 PROJA\_USR WAITING FO 2296 450 2296 235.5 .0 sqlplus@aser resmgr:cpu quantum PROJ\_A\_GRP 491 PROJA\_USR RUNNING 2295 449 2295 236.1 .0 sqlplus@aser resmgr:cpu quantum PROJ\_B\_GRP 498 PROJB\_USR RUNNING 2168 358 2170 326.7 .0 sqlplus@aser resmgr:cpu quantum OTHER\_GROUP 490 myuser0 RUNNING 853 36 853 648.6 .0 sqlplus@aser resmgr:cpu quantum OTHER\_GROUP 1075 myuser0 RUNNING 60 2 60 683.9 .0 sqlplus@aser resmgr:cpu quantum PROJ\_D\_GRP 1079 PROJD\_USR WAITING FO 2131 269 2131 414.9 .0 sqlplus@aser resmgr:cpu quantum \[/sourcecode\]

**So, I'm puzzled** - I thought that RM was supposed to allocate a guarenteed amount of CPU to each consumer group. But here we're seeing consumer groups with only one session getting apparently muscled out by those with multiple sessions. If OTHER\_GROUPS is taking 25%, that leaves a hypothetical 75% between four consumer groups to split 25% each (so c.18% each). Instead two of the four get 25% total host CPU and two get about 6% host CPU - not 25% of the remainder of the pie left by OTHER\_GROUPS.

**Update:** I re-ran Test 07, but observed the same behaviour: \[sourcecode\] Total Available Used Oracle Throttled TIME CONSUMER\_GROUP\_NAME CPU Seconds Oracle Seconds % of Host CPU Time (s) ------------------- ------------------------------ --------------- -------------- ------------- ---------------- 2010-13-09 07:53:42 PROJ\_C\_GRP 480 145.0 30.2 448.5 PROJ\_A\_GRP 480 132.8 27.7 163.9 PROJ\_B\_GRP 480 21.3 4.4 38.3 OTHER\_GROUPS 480 115.8 24.1 3.2 PROJ\_D\_GRP 480 21.9 4.6 37.5 SYS\_GROUP 480 0.0 0.0 0.0 \_ORACLE\_BACKGROUND\_GROUP\_ 480 0.0 0.0 0.0 \[/sourcecode\]

_Why aren't and PROJ\_B\_GRP PROJ\_D\_GRP getting an equal share of CPU as PROJ\_A\_GRP and PROJ\_C\_GRP?_

## What's next?

I'm going to re-run some of the above tests to check that the same behaviour is seen. I'm also planning to test with non-Oracle processes using lots of CPU to see how RM deals with that. We're considering how RM fits into Performance Testing our applications, as it introduces quite a possible varience in the response times the users could see in Production. Finally, it will be interesting to observe RM in action against real DW workloads where there may be lots of I/O waits and not pure CPU demand.

## Summmary

It's been very interesting running these tests and looking closely at what RM appears to be doing. Some of my understanding & assumptions have been challenged, and I would love to hear from people with more experience and knowlegde of RM and Oracle to explain what I'm observing and where I've gone wrong. All of the query results quoted here are representative of the steady-state seen during each test. I'm sure I've just misunderstood part of the principle of RM, but I would like to know in what way :-) and also if there is a way to implement what I thought we had - a way of ensuring that of four consumer groups they all get a fair and equal bite of the pie.
