I'm doing my first ever conference presentation next month at the [2010 Rittman Mead BI Forum](http://www.rittmanmead.com/biforum2010/).

My presentation is called **Performance Testing OBIEE**, which is something I've spent a lot of time working on over the last few months. I think the challenge is going to be distilling it all into a session that's not going to overwhelm everyone or bore them to death! Well, actually, the challenge is going to be the presenting. I can talk geek one-on-one, but talking to a whole bunch of people, not wittering but staying focussed, holding their attention....uh oh.

I'd love to hear from anyone, particularly seasoned conference speakers, with any suggestions for not making a complete foul-up of my presentation :-)

I [put the question out on Twitter yesterday](http://twitter.com/rnm1978/status/12530066863) and got the following helpful advice from [Pete Scott](http://twitter.com/dw_pete) of [RittmanMead](http://www.rittmanmead.com/) ![](/images/rnm1978/2010-04-21_170548.png "2010-04-21_170548") and from [Lisa Dobson](http://twitter.com/lj_dobson): ![](/images/rnm1978/2010-04-21_170818.png "2010-04-21_170818")

I've sat through enough death by powerpoint presentations where all too often the contents of the presentation go in the deck, and then someone reads through them. ![](/images/rnm1978/83078-strip.gif "83078.strip") Ultimately there has to be something that I add by being in the room instead of just emailing the deck to everyone! Do I go brave and take after [Doug Burns'](http://oracledoug.com/) "How I learned to love Pictures" and do minimal slides and then talk & demo? Is having ppt slides a useful crutch for someone not used to presenting?

So - help out a newbie - post your hints, tips, suggestions & comments here please :)
