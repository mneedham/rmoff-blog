OK, [a bit tired](http://twitter.com/#!/rnm1978/status/98045868221018113) on a Monday morning, and so a bit sarcastic.

I've not really fallen off my chair, but I am shocked. I honestly didn't think it would happen.

Oracle have finally released OBI 11g for HP-UX Itanium:

In other news, patchset 10.1.3.4.2 for OBI 10g was released today, I wonder if/when we'll get an HP-UX Itanium version? The download page has it conspicuous by its absence even from "Coming Soon": ![](/images/rnm1978/2011-08-08_0755_-0000.png "2011-08-08_0755_ 0000")
