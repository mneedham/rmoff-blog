Very interesting post by Kevin McGinley about CAF here:Â  [CAF = Migration Utility? Use Caution!](http://oraclebiblog.blogspot.com/2009/12/caf-migration-utility-use-caution.html)

It articulates better than I ever could reasons against using CAF particularly in a production environment.

Since the tool came out I'd been struggling to get my head around it, convinced I was missing something. I still don't profess to understand it properly, but Kevin's article reassures me that I shouldn't be losing too much sleep over it, especially given that it's unsupported and [won't work with 11g](http://www.oracle.com/technology/obe/obe_bi/bi_ee_1013/caf/caf.html#t1).
