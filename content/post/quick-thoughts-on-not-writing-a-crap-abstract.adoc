I've reviewed a bunch of abstracts in the last couple of days, here are some common suggestions I made: 

- No need to include your company name in the abstract text. Chances are I've not heard of your company, and even if I have, what does it add to my comprehension of your abstract and what you're going to talk about? Possible exception would be the "hot" tech companies where people will see a talk just because it's Netflix etc
- I _really_ don't want just to read your project documentation/summary. It makes me worry your talk will be death by PowerPoint of the minutiae of something that's only relevant in your company. 
- Following on from above, I want to see that there's going to be things you'll share _that are useful for other people in a similar situation_. Something that's specific to your project, your company, doesn't translate to mass-usefulness. Something that other people will hit, whether it's technical or org-cultural, now _that_ is interesting and is going to be useful
- If my eyes start to glaze over reading the abstract intro, already I'm assuming that your talk will make me bored too. Read it back out loud to yourselfâ€¦make sure each word justifies its place in the text. Boilerplate filler and waffle should be left on the cutting room floor. 
- You need to strike a balance between giving enough detail about the contents of your talk that I am convinced you have interesting things to share, but without listing every nut and bolt of detail. Too much detail and it just becomes a laundry list. You need to whet people's appetite for the actual meal, not put them off their food. 
- For heaven's sake, proof read! If you can't be arsed to use a spell checker, then I definitely wouldn't trust you to prepare a talk of any quality. I've recently started using https://app.grammarly.com/[Grammarly] and it's _excellent_. 

This is all just IMHO, and I would strongly caveat it that I've never been on a program committee, so maybe others out there can set me straight if I'm going against the grain on any of this.

* I'm always open to helping review draft abstracts; if you'd like me to look at yours put it in a Google Doc with review permissions and send it over to me.

Some good feedback from https://twitter.com/rawkode[David McKay] in response to this article: 

> I always find that negative titles, on context and subject, particularly annoying; more so when it's a double negative.
>
> Your article, for example, would be better in the positive context of "Traps to Avoid When Writing an Abstract"

Which I totally agree with. I've stuck with the original title out of sheer stubbornness, and a reflection on the grump I was in after reviewing a crap abstract ;)

More good feedback, from https://twitter.com/er1p[Erik Riedel]: 

> there is a lot tied up in your 5th bullet - and I recently read some twitter CFP advice (forget from who) what you should put ALL the "coolest" points into your abstract - vs trying to save some sizzle for the talk itself - i.e. the reviewers want to know ALL the coolness, because they are judging against the entire mass of other submitted coolnesses - even if you would want only hook/bait for the abstract that will be in the conference program - I'd suggest you make that point part of your 5th bullet somehow - i.e. "whatever you do, make sure ALL your COOLEST points from the talk are in the abstract - the sizzle" - ok to leave out "nuts and bolts" as you say
