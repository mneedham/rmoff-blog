== Broken theme

The theme used (https://github.com/xaprb/story[story]) is no longer maintained, and is broken with the latest version of Hugo (`0.96.0`). It may be broken with earlier versions too (I've not built it for a while). It does work with `0.82.1``.

I found this https://discourse.gohugo.io/t/cant-evaluate-field-hugo-in-hugolib-pagestate/37862/3[relevant thread] but don't understand enough about Hugo and its themes to do anything other than hack aroundâ€¦so instead I'm just hard-coding my dependence back to 0.82 and leaving it there. Maybe at some point I'll try out a new theme (yak shaving when I should be doing something else ;-) )
